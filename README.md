Assignment from Introduction to Computer Programming in FiE UNMC (2017/18)


As usual, there always an Assignment from the programming class and I with my teammate (Eu Boon) willing to share the code that we have completed for the assignment.

P/S: If you’re Da*m lazy, just go to the bottom of the page.

It is a messy repository as previously for our convenience, we use TFS with the combination of Git to upload the project. So there is a simple guide to our repository here.
There are two components in our program. An interface part of the program which it is programmed by me (Msall_98) and the algorithm part with managed and programmed by Eu Boon. The interface was initially programmed with Kivy framework which previously was located in “Interface_Alpha_Stage” folder but I have removed most of the stuff in the end and programmed with Tkinter Framework as the framework’s wiki was not informative enough during that stage and the framework wasn’t my taste also. “The Loan Calculator” sample program from EthanSeaver (You can find him from GitHub too) was used as a basic guide for how to make an interface with Tkinter.
For the algorithm part, the purpose of this program is to calculate the monthly installment you'll have to pay for loaning money to pay for a car that costs less than RM 9 000 000 over a period of 1- 10 years
The algorithm that this program uses is as follows:

<b><i>loanamount=float(price)-float(down_payment)

Total_interest=(float(interest_rate)/100)timeloanamount

Monthly_interest=Total_interest/(time12)

Monthly_installment=(loanamount+Total_interest)/(time12)</i></b>

To use the program, simply run it and enter the relevant information. Details of the loaning information will be recorded in a notepad document in the same file as the code.

P/S: First time running the code may take some time to run as the text file will have to be created first.

******************************************************************************************************************

Interface_Alpha_Stage ==> A previous testing ground with Kivy Framwork.

Main ==> Initial Algorithm part of the code.

PythonApplication1 ==> Initial test with Git upload.

PythonApplication2 ==> Second Update on the Algorithm.

PythonApplication3 ==> Trying to merge two part into one for the first time.

PythonApplication4 ==> Final Program fix small bug fixes.

Macaroni ==> First Codename for the program, earlier than “Main” and only with the algorithm part only.

Ravioli ==> Second Codename for the program, second edit of the Program with interface.
